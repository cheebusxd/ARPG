    <h2>The Phoenix Who Rose From The Ashes, Path Of Exile.</h2>
    <p>Grinding Gear Games, a New Zealand based video game developer was founded in 2006.
        They released the Beta on January 23rd 2013 where nearly 46,000 people participated and would
        eventually release the game on October 23rd, 2013. In a mere 6 days, they managed to
        get 245,000$ in crowd funding by letting players to pre-purchase in-game microtransactions 
        for cosmetics, helping the hail mary start that the games developers had as an indie
        and individual company.
